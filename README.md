Python 3, pip, pipenv

## Description
Code for programming assignments of Andew Ng's Deep Learning specialization course.

*See [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) for details*.

While code completes the same programming assignments as in the course, the code structure may be slightly different.

Refactoring was mostly done to take into account best practices and optimization of the algorithms.
